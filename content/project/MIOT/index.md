A Spanish project funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Agencia Estatal de Investigaci√≥n) and Ministry of Science and Innovation with European Regional Development Funds (AEI/FEDER, UE). The general objective of this project is to create a design proposal for building comprehensive microservice-oriented IoT systems. This methodology will ensure relevant technical quality properties to support holistic and ecological user assessments in the eHealth domain, particularly to promote healthy and active ageing.
