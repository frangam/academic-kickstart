I am currently working on this R&D Project entitled "MIoT-Health: Microservice-oriented design of IoT systems for a holistic and ecological assessment in eHealth - A case study of active and healthy ageing" (ref: PID2019-109644RB-I00).

The general objective of this R&D project is to create a design proposal for building comprehensive microservice-oriented IoT systems. This methodology will ensure relevant technical quality properties to support holistic and ecological user assessments in the eHealth domain, particularly to promote healthy and active ageing.

I will applied my expertise focused on Data Science, Machine Learning and Bioinformatics applied to Medicine.
