abstract = {The increasing adoption of mobile computing technology in the health and social domains offers new possibilities, for instance, promoting active aging. Health deterioration in elderly people could be successfully assessed by monitoring activities of daily living (ADLs) through mobile technology. In particular, frailty affects several dimensions (physical, psychological, and social) of human functioning, which are required to perform instrumental ADLs (IADLs). Starting from the definition of a model, this paper proposes the design of an intelligent mobile health system to assess frailty in an ecological way: to automatize the frailty assessment through wearable sensors, unobtrusively in free-living environments, and using machine learning in order to reduce the traditional efforts of clinicians assessing frailty. It supports automatic data collection from sensors and artificial intelligence analysis during the performance of real IADLs by elderly. The proposed system uses mobile/wearable devices, follows a microservices software architecture, and implements machine learning algorithms. A technical validation of the proposal is shown.},
